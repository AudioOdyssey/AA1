    <h3>Our Story</h3>
    <p>The original concept for AudioOdyssey was born during a hackathon at Hyland Software in Westlake, Ohio in January of 2019. After taking home first place in the high school division, the founding members did not intially intend on pursuing the project futher. However, when they were approached by one of the judges of the competition, Miguel Zubizeretta, and offered summer jobs developing their project they agreed ecstatically! AudioOdyssey officially began development in the summer of 2019.</p>
