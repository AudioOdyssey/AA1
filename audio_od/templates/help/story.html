        "location" in the game. Locations do not necessarily need to be literal locations as you would think of them
        in real life (ex "the grocery store" "school" etc.). They can also be abstract "locations" that represent
        points in the your story (anywhere a new description is required).

        things that can NOT be transferred
        between locations do not need to be entered as objects and can just be written about in a description. Also note
        that items entered as objects do not need to be
        mentioned in a description because upon entry to a location the user will be told which objects are in the room
        (unless the object is hidden).
