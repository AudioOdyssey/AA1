    <h2 class= "title">Location Entry</h2>
    <body class ="body">Locations contain the main audio messages that are played each time the user enters a new
        "location" in the game. Locations do not necessarily need to be literal locations as you would think of them
        in real life (ex "the grocery store" "school" etc.). They can also be abstract "locations" that represent
        points in the your story (anywhere a new description is required)
